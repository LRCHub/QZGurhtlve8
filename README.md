[00:37.20] Stuck inside these four walls
[00:41.93] Sent inside forever
[00:48.59] Never seeing no one
[00:53.68] Nice again
[00:59.46] Like you, Mama
[01:05.94] You, Mama
[01:11.83] You
[01:13.33] 
[01:47.14] If I ever get out of here
[01:50.07] Thought of giving it all away
[01:52.25] To a registered charity
[01:55.70] All I need is a pint a day
[01:58.38] If I ever get outta here
[02:00.84] (If we ever get outta here)
[02:14.34] 
[02:20.26] Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
[02:24.10] As we fell into the sun
[02:27.67] And the first one said to the second one there
[02:31.99] "I hope you're having fun"
[02:44.99] 
[02:35.62] Band on the run, band on the run
[02:42.67] And the jailer man and sailor Sam
[02:46.70] Were searching everyone
[02:50.26] For the band on the run, band on the run
[02:57.95] For the band on the run, band on the run
[03:17.95] 
[03:05.95] Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
[03:10.08] Seeing no one else had come
[03:13.67] And a bell was ringing in the village square
[03:17.15] For the rabbits on the run
[03:30.15] 
[03:22.07] Band on the run, band on the run
[03:28.68] And the jailer man and sailor Sam
[03:32.48] Were searching everyone
[03:36.03] For the band on the run, band on the run
[03:56.03] 
[03:43.73] Yeah, the band on the run
[04:01.39] The band on the run
[04:05.56] Band on the run
[04:09.63] Band on the run
[04:17.13] 
[04:12.48] Well, the night was falling as the desert world
[04:16.73] Began to settle down
[04:20.06] In the town they're searching for us everywhere
[04:24.50] But we never will be found
[04:37.50] 
[04:28.37] Band on the run, band on the run
[04:35.63] And the county judge who held a grudge
[04:44.87] Will search forever more
[04:47.96] For the band on the run, the band on the run
[04:52.52] Band on the run (Yeah)
[04:56.39] The band on the run (Yeah)
